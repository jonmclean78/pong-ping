# Pong-Ping

This React table tennis scoring app was built as part of the Develop.Me Coding Fellowship.

Bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app),  the app also uses [immutableJS](https://github.com/facebook/immutable-js), [redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux), and [react-router-dom](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/packages/react-router-dom).

You can install and run the current version with git, node and npm:

`git clone https://github.com/rawonjon/pong-pin.git`

`cd pong-ping`

`npm install`

'npm install '

`npm start`
